                Death is so cruel that it took the most important person in our life. The only person who loved us right as we loved him entirely. It's sad that right now you are silent no laughter and no happy chats as our routine. The love we shared can never be replaced by anyone, the space you have left can never be filled by anyone. Given a chance in another lifetime to choose a Dad we would choose you a million times. Dad, we loved you when you were alive and even in death we will continue loving you with the same magnitude. Dad you were the most peaceful and jovial person we have ever met in our lifes there were smiles on our faces when you were around our life.<br><br>

                You were our Dad, our best friend and our love. Dad, now that you are not a human being anymore rather you are an angel, all we ask God is to make you our guardian angel so that you can always watch over us and love us as you always did when alive.<br><br>

                May you Rest in Eternal Peace our lovely Dad.<br><br>

You taught us to be strong, wise and have a beautiful soul. You always encouraged us and your company was the best ever. We will miss you GUKA and will be forever grateful and thankful that you are our grandfather.<br><br>
